# rubber-band-method

This is a reimplementation of a [program](https://web.archive.org/web/20071210071004/http://www.cs.elte.hu/~lovasz/tuttedemo.html) written orginally by **László Lovász**.

This program illustrates how one simple mathematical idea -- replacing the edges of a graph by rubber bands -- can be used to design a variety of graph algorithms.
