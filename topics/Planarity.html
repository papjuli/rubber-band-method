  <h2>How to draw a graph?</h2>

  <p>On the right, the dodecahedron graph is loaded. One face of the dodecahedron is drawn as a regular pentagon (the 5 red nodes); the remaining nodes are put in random position. The five red nodes are fixed, the others can move.</p>

  <p>Click on the <b>Run</b> button. The edges contract until the system reaches equilibrium. The edges don't cross any more, and we get a pretty drawing of the dodecahedron.</p>


  <p><em>Does this work because the dodecahedron graph is very symmetric?</em></p>

  <p>Load the graph named "planar1". This is a planar graph where the nodes of one face (the red nodes) are fixed to a square, but the other nodes are in a random position. Click Run: The edges contract and eventually they will not cross any more.</p>

  <p>Play with the other planar graphs: try out all five platonic solids, and the other, less regular planar graphs.</p>

  <p>Hint: You can modify the graphs using the methods under the Edit menu: see Help.</p>


  <p>Tutte proved the following nontrivial fact:</p>

  <blockquote>Nail the nodes of any face of a 3-connected planar graph to a convex polygon, and replace the edges by rubber bands. The equilibrium provides an embedding in the plane.</blockquote>
  
  <p>This embedding has very nice properties: all the edges are straight line segments, and all the faces are convex polygons.</p>


  <p>Is this a good method to display planar 3-connected graphs?</p>

  <p>Often it is, but there are some bad examples. Load the graph named "triangles" and click Run: This simple graph is drawn in the plane, but most of its nodes are crowded near the middle of the bottom. The "pipe" graph gives a similar example.</p>

  <p>What to do if a planar graph is not 3-connected?</p>

  <p>We can add edges to it to make it 3-connected, and delete these at the end. As a special case, a tree can be drawn nicely by fixing its leaves. Try the "tree5" graph.</p>

  <p>Is this a good method to display nonplanar graphs? Sometimes; load and run the Petersen graph to see a nice drawing of this very famous and very symmetric nonplanar graph.</p>
