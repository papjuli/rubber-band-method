  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>This webpage is a reimplementation of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071210071004/http://www.cs.elte.hu/~lovasz/tuttedemo.html" target="_blank">program</a> written by <b>László Lovász</b>. The original is a Windows program, and some of its functionality doesn't work on modern Windows. Lovász dedicated the program to the memory of W.T.Tutte.</p>

  <p>This program illustrates how one simple mathematical idea: replacing the edges of a graph by rubber bands, can be used to design a variety of graph algorithms:<p>
  <ul>
    <li><em>drawing a <span class="tooltip">
  planar<span class="tooltip-content" style="display:none;">
    A graph is <b>planar</b> if it can be drawn in the plane so that the edges are continuous curves that do not intersect each other. Such a drawing is called an <b>embedding</b> of the graph in the plane.
  </span></span> graph in the plane</em>, a method of Tutte (1963);</li>
    <li><em>connectivity testing</em>, an algorithm of Linial, Lovász and Wigderson (1988);</li>
    <li><em>maximum cut</em>, an approximation algorithm of Goemans and Williamson (1994);</li>
    <li><em>squaring a rectangle</em>, a construction of Brooks, Smith, Stone and Tutte (1940).</li>
  </ul>
