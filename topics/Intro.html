  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <h4><em>Dedicated to the memory of W.T.Tutte</em></h4>

  <p>This program illustrates how one simple mathematical idea (replacing the edges of a graph by rubber bands) can be used to design a variety of graph algorithms:<p>
  <ul>
    <li><em>drawing a planar graph in the plane</em>, a method of Tutte (1963);</li>
    <li><em>connectivity testing</em>, an algorithm of Linial, Lov√°sz and Wigderson (1988);</li>
    <li><em>maximum cut</em>, an approximation algorithm of Goemans and Williamson (1994);</li>
    <li><em>squaring a rectangle</em>, a construction of Brooks, Smith, Stone and Tutte (1940).</li>
  </ul>
